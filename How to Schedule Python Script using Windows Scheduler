Step-1: Prepare the Python Script

Write the code or get the script

Step-2: Save the Python Script

Once you’re done writing the script, save it as a Python file (where the file extension is .py):

For instance, let’s save the file as hello_world.py under the following path:
C:\Users\Ron\Desktop\hello_world.py

Step-3: Create Batch File to Run the Python Script

Next, create a batch file to run the Python script.

To start, open Notepad, and then use the following template:

"Path where your Python exe is stored\python.exe" "Path where your Python script is stored\script name.py"
pause

For our example:

    The path where the Python exe is stored is:
    “C:\Users\Ron\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\python.exe”
    The Path where the Python script is stored is (see step-2):
    “C:\Users\Ron\Desktop\hello_world.py”

Here are the paths in the Notepad (you’ll need to adjust those paths to fit your instances):

"C:\Users\Ron\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\python.exe" "C:\Users\Ron\Desktop\hello_world.py"
pause

Finally, save the Notepad with your file name and the “bat” file extension:

file_name.bat

For example, let’s save the Notepad as:

run_python_script.bat

Once you save the Notepad, a new batch file (called run_python_script) will be created at the specified location:
C:\Users\Ron\Desktop\run_python_script.bat
Step-4: Schedule the Python Script using the Windows Scheduler

In order to schedule the Python script using the Windows Scheduler:

    Open the Windows Control Panel and then click on the Administrative Tools
    Double-click on the Task Scheduler, and then choose the option to ‘Create Basic Task…’
    Type a name for your task (you can also type a description if needed), and then press Next. For instance, let’s name the task as: Run Hello World
    Choose to start the task ‘Daily‘ since we wish to run the Python script daily at 6am. Also specify the start date and time (6am for our example)
    Select, Start a program, and then press Next
    Use the Browse button to find the batch file (run_python_script.bat) that runs the Python script. In our case:

C:\Users\Ron\Desktop\run_python_script.bat

Finally, click on Finish, and you should be good to go. From this point onward, you’ll be greeted with ‘Hello World!’ everyday at 6am.
